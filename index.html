              Multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) have shown
              promising abilities for solving complex tasks in a collaborative manner.
              This work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent collaboration:
              <em>consensus seeking</em>. In particular, when multiple agents work
              together, we are interested in how they can reach a consensus through
              inter-agent negotiation given that they have different initial solutions
              for a task. To that end, this work studies an abstract consensus-seeking
              task, where the state of each agent is a numerical number and they negotiate
              with each other to reach a consensus value. We found that when not explicitly
              directed on which strategy should be adopted, the LLM-driven agents tend to
              use the <em>average strategy</em> for consensus seeking although they may
              also use some other strategies occasionally. Moreover, this work analyzes the
              impact of agents' <em>personalities</em> and <em>network topologies</em> on
              the negotiation process. It is shown that stubborn agents tend to dominate the
              consensus outcome, resulting in leader-follower structures, while network
              topologies can influence the speed and success of consensus convergence. The
              significance of this work lies in its potential to lay the foundations for
              understanding the behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to reach consensus
              in collaborative problem-solving tasks.

          <strong>Background:</strong> In recent months, multi-agent systems
          driven by LLMs have received rapidly increasing attention. Researchers
          found that the problem-solving ability of LLMs can be significantly
          enhanced through collaboration between multiple agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Topic addressed:</strong> Our present work focuses on a
          fundamental problem in multi-agent systems: consensus seeking. When
          multiple LLMs are used to solve the same task, they may have different
          solutions initially, but they can eventually reach the same solution
          through continuous negotiation. This is essentially a consensus-seeking
          process. Consensus seeking also widely exists in collective
          decision-making systems such as animal groups and human societies. It is
          also a core research problem in the fields of multi-robot systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Research gap:</strong> Consensus seeking via LLMs has not been
          specifically studied so far. There are many important questions that
          need to be answered. For instance, if we use multiple LLMs to assist us
          in negotiations or problem-solving, it is important for us to know
          whether they can eventually reach a consensus amongst themselves. If
          they can, how long would it take and what factors can influence the
          final consensus outcome? If they cannot, what factors may lead to this
          failure? The answers to these questions play a pivotal role in our
          proper utilization of LLMs.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Problem setup:</strong> In this work, we study a specific
          consensus-seeking task. Specifically, in an LLM-driven multi-agent
          system, each agent starts with an initial state represented by a
          numerical value. The objective for them is to continuously adjust their
          states to achieve the same final state. Throughout this process, each
          agent can perceive the states of the other agents, and based on this
          information, formulate strategies to adjust their own states.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>

          <li>
            <strong>Consensus strategy:</strong> When not explicitly directed on
            which strategy the agents should adopt, they often tend to use an
            <em>average strategy</em> for consensus seeking although they may also
            use some other strategies occasionally. The average strategy means
            they set their state in the next round as the average value of the
            current states of all agents. This is a reasonable strategy that shows
            the agent is considerate and collaborative.

            Interestingly, the average consensus algorithm is a widely adopted
            algorithm in the field of multi-agent cooperative control. In that
            context, each agent is modeled as a dynamic system governed by ordinary
            differential or difference equations (ODEs). Our present work reveals
            the relationship between the behavior exhibited by
            <em>LLM-driven</em> and <em>ODE-driven</em> multi-agent systems. The
            existing theoretical results of consensus algorithms can provide a
            theoretical foundation to help us understand LLM-driven multi-agent
            systems.

            We further analyze the influence of some important factors.

            <strong>Impact of personality:</strong> A person's personality often
            plays a significant role in negotiation and collaboration tasks.
            Motivated by this, we examined two types of personalities:
            <em>stubborn</em> and <em>suggestible</em>. Compared to suggestible
            agents, stubborn agents tend to insist on their views and are less
            likely to change easily. We observed that stubborn agents have a
            dominant influence on the final consensus value of the group, leading
            the entire system to display a leader-follower structure.

            <strong>Impact of topology:</strong> The flow of information in a
            multi-agent system corresponds to a network topology, which plays a
            pivotal role in negotiations. We examined several typical network
            topologies. For instance, when the network is fully connected, the
            exchange of information is most efficient, resulting in fast consensus
            convergence speed. When the network is not fully connected, the
            consensus convergence speed slows down. In the case of directed
            graphs, a leader-follower hierarchical structure emerges since some
            agents have a dominant influence on the final consensus outcome. In
            some systems, due to the interplay between personality and topology, a
            consensus may not be reached, leading to clustering outcomes.

            <strong>Impact of agent number:</strong> It is shown by Monte Carlo
            simulation that as the number of agents increases, the variance of the
            final consensus value decreases and the mean gets closer to the
            average value of the initial agent states. This observation suggests
            that multiple agents can alleviate the randomness or hallucinations of
            the system so that a consistent outcome can be obtained. Moreover,
            while a small number of suggestible agents may cause oscillations of
            their states, a large number of them can suppress the occurrence of
            oscillations, suggesting that increasing the number of agents may
            stabilize group decision-making.
