        <strong>Background:</strong> In recent months, multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) have
        received rapidly increasing attention. It is reported that the problem-solving ability of LLMs can be
        significantly enhanced through collaboration between multiple agents. The works in MetaGPT, CAMEL, and ChatDev
        break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, which are then handled by different agents separately. These
        collaboration strategies, to some extent, can reduce hallucinations and enhance the ability to solve complex
        tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Topic addressed:</strong> Our work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems: consensus
        seeking. When multiple LLMs are used to solve the same task, they may have different solutions initially, but
        they can eventually reach the same solution through continuous negotiation. This is essentially a
        consensus-seeking process. Consensus seeking also widely exists in collective decision-making systems such as
        animal groups and human societies. It is also a core research problem in the fields of multi-robot systems and
        federated learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Research gap:</strong> Consensus seeking via LLMs has not been specifically studied so far. There are
        many important questions that need to be answered. For instance, if we use multiple LLMs to assist us in
        negotiations or problem-solving, it is important for us to know whether they can eventually reach a consensus
        amongst themselves. If they can, how long would it take and what factors can influence the final consensus
        outcome? If they cannot, what factors may lead to this failure? The answers to these questions play a pivotal
        role in our proper utilization of LLMs. For example, it would be beneficial if we could predict the final
        negotiation outcome even before deploying LLMs or we know how to obtain desired negotiation outcomes by
        adjusting some prompts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Problem setup:</strong> In this work, we study a specific consensus-seeking task. Specifically, in an
        LLM-driven multi-agent system, each agent starts with an initial state represented by a numerical value. The
        objective for them is to continuously adjust their states to achieve the same final state. Throughout this
        process, each agent can perceive the states of the other agents, and based on this information, formulate
        strategies to adjust their own states.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This consensus-seeking task is an abstraction of more complex tasks.
        Understanding this simple task can lay the necessary foundations for understanding more complex ones.
        Specifically, in this task, the state of each agent corresponds to a point in the set of real numbers. In more
        complex tasks, the state of each agent may correspond to a point within a more complex set (e.g., a set of
        solutions).</p>

      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>

        <li>
          <strong>Consensus strategy:</strong> When not explicitly directed on which strategy the agents should adopt,
          they often tend to use an <em>average strategy</em> for consensus seeking although they may also occasionally
          use some other strategies. By the average strategy, an agent sets its state in the next round as the average
          value of the current states of all agents. This strategy shows that the agent is considerate and
          collaborative. Interestingly, the <em>average consensus</em> is a well-studied problem in the field of
          multi-agent cooperative control. In that context, each agent is modeled as a dynamic system governed by
          ordinary differential or difference equations (ODEs). This work reveals the similarity between the behavior
          exhibited by <em>LLM-driven</em> and <em>ODE-driven</em> multi-agent systems. The existing theoretical results
          of ODE-driven agents can provide a theoretical foundation to help us understand LLM-driven agents.

          <strong>Impact of personality:</strong> A person's personality often plays a significant role in negotiation
          and collaboration tasks. Motivated by this, we examined two types of personalities: <em>stubborn</em> and
          <em>suggestible</em>. Compared to suggestible agents, stubborn agents tend to insist on their views and are
          less likely to change. We observed that stubborn agents have a dominant influence on the final consensus value
          of the group, leading the entire system to display a leader-follower structure.

        <li>
          <strong>Impact of topology:</strong> The flow of information in a multi-agent system corresponds to a
          network topology, which plays a pivotal role in negotiations. We examined several typical network topologies.
          For instance, when the network is fully connected, the exchange of information is most efficient, resulting in
          fast consensus convergence speed. When the network is not fully connected, the consensus convergence speed
          slows down. In the case of directed graphs, a leader-follower hierarchical structure emerges since some agents
          have a dominant influence on the final consensus outcome. In some systems, due to the interplay between
          personality and topology, consensus may not be reached, leading to clustering outcomes.

        <li>
          <strong>Impact of agent number:</strong> It is shown by Monte Carlo simulation that as the number of agents
          increases, the variance of the final consensus value decreases. This suggests that multiple agents can
          alleviate the randomness or hallucinations of the system so that a consistent outcome can be obtained in
          different trials. Moreover, while a small number of suggestible agents may cause oscillations of their states,
          a large number of them can suppress the occurrence of oscillations, suggesting that increasing the number of
          agents may stabilize group decision-making.

      <p><strong>Application to multi-robot aggregation: </strong>
        The LLM-driven consensus seeking framework is further applied as a
        cooperative planner to a multi-robot aggregation task. In this task, multiple robots starting from different
        initial positions plan and move to a common position in the plane. It is a consensus seeking problem in
        Euclidean space. This application is important since it shows the potential of LLM-driven agents to achieve
        zero-shot
        autonomous task planning based on simple verbal commands.
