    Multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) have shown 
    promising abilities for solving complex tasks in a collaborative manner. 
    This work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent collaboration: 
    <em>consensus seeking</em>. In particular, when multiple agents work 
    together, we are interested in how they can reach a consensus through 
    inter-agent negotiation given that they have different initial solutions 
    for a task. To that end, this work studies an abstract consensus-seeking 
    task, where the state of each agent is a numerical number and they negotiate 
    with each other to reach a consensus value. We found that when not explicitly 
    directed on which strategy should be adopted, the LLM-driven agents tend to 
    use the <em>average strategy</em> for consensus seeking although they may 
    also use some other strategies occasionally. Moreover, this work analyzes the 
    impact of agents' <em>personalities</em> and <em>network topologies</em> on 
    the negotiation process. It is shown that stubborn agents tend to dominate the 
    consensus outcome, resulting in leader-follower structures, while network 
    topologies can influence the speed and success of consensus convergence. The 
    significance of this work lies in its potential to lay the foundations for 
    understanding the behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to reach consensus 
    in collaborative problem-solving tasks.
